# Practice of FastAPI Project

In this folder, the graduate progress of building a FastAPI project is recorded.

There are three sub-folders of FastAPI projects in the `Practice` folder:

1. `myToDo_01_Draft`: a single `main.py` to launch the FastAPI application of a TODO list project.
2. `myToDo_02_Dev`: extend the TODO list project in `myToDo_01_Draft` with multiple modules for scalability and testability.
3. `myToDo_03_Prod`: enhance the TODO list project in `myToDo_02_Dev` with database, authentication, schema validation, CI/CD, etc into 'production-ready' project.

Note: We always work in a single folder, in this case, I just separated the folders for demonstration.
